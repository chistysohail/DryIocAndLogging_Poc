DryIoc Airport: A Fun Journey Through Dependency Injection
Welcome to DryIoc Airport, where flights to Code Quality land take off daily. Here's a simple guide to help you understand the bustling world of dependency injection, using nothing more than an airport analogy that even a layman can enjoy. So, buckle up and prepare for takeoff!

The Airport (Your Application)
Imagine our airport as the application you're building. It's a complex system with many moving parts: from handling baggage to controlling air traffic. Each of these functions requires specific services and tools to operate smoothly, just like your application needs various classes and dependencies.

Airlines and Planes (Interfaces and Implementations)
At our airport, different airlines represent interfaces, and their planes are the implementations of these interfaces. For instance, the ILogger airline promises to deliver messages (logs), and the ConsoleLogger is one of its planes, flying messages directly to the console terminal.

The Control Tower (DryIoc Container)
The heart of our airport is the control tower, which is like the DryIoc container in your application. It knows all flights (dependencies) scheduled, what services each plane (class) requires to fly, and directs them where to go. It ensures that when a DatabaseManager flight is ready to depart, it gets a ConsoleLogger plane to carry its logs.

Boarding Passes and Gate Assignments (Dependency Resolution)
When a flight is ready to board, passengers (methods) need to know which gate (dependency) to go to. The control tower (DryIoc) issues boarding passes (resolves dependencies), ensuring everyone boards the correct plane (gets the right implementation). So when DatabaseManager announces, "Querying database with SQL: SELECT * FROM Users," it knows exactly which ILogger plane to board.

The Flight (Running Your Application)
Once all passengers are boarded, and dependencies resolved, the flight can take off. As our DatabaseManager flight cruises, it uses the ConsoleLogger airline to send messages back to the airport terminal. You, watching the console screen, see "ConsoleLogger: Querying database with SQL: SELECT * FROM Users" flying across, indicating our flight is on course and our dependencies are working harmoniously.

Layovers (Mocking for Testing)
Sometimes, flights have layovers in Testville before reaching Code Quality land. Here, the control tower (DryIoc) might decide to switch planes (use mocks) to ensure the passengers (methods) still enjoy their journey without actually flying far. This is where our NSubstitute comes into play, providing a mock ILogger flight for a quick hop around the airport, testing how well our passengers react to turbulence (code changes).

Arrival
Congratulations! You've successfully navigated the world of DryIoc Airport. Your journey through dependency injection has shown you how an application's parts come together, ensuring a smooth and efficient operation, much like planes, airlines, and control towers work together to manage flights.

Thank You for Flying with DryIoc Airport
We hope you enjoyed your flight and now have a better understanding of dependency injection and DryIoc. Remember, whether you're dealing with logs or luggage, the right services and tools make for a successful journey. Happy coding, and we look forward to seeing you on your next flight to Code Quality land!
